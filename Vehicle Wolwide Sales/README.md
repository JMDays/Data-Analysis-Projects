__Title:__ Data Analysis of a Vehcicle Sales Dataset. 
  In this project, SQL was used for data cleaning, and afterward, to extract some relevant conclusions from a business point of view (POV).
  The company sells different kinds of vehicles for various clients worldwide. Three years of data are considered (2003, 2004 and 2005).
It is possible to access the respective section of the SQL code by the links provided bellow.
In a second phase, with the data already cleaned, Power BI was used to create visualizations that facilitate the analysis and interpretation of the results.


__I - Data Cleaning__

__II - Data Analysis___

__1) Which month has the highest sales volume?__
https://github.com/JMDays/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Vehicle%20Wolwide%20Sales/Vehicles%20Worldwide%20Sales%20_.sql#L206

  April has the highest sales, followed by November and May, indicating strong performance in spring and late fall. 
	However, sales dip in July, August, and December. 
	It would be advised to apply target marketing efforts to boost sales during these weaker months

__2) Which products had the top 10 higuest profit margin?__
https://github.com/JMDays/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Vehicle%20Wolwide%20Sales/Vehicles%20Worldwide%20Sales%20_.sql#L217

  Vintage Cars generally have higher profit margins compared to Classic Cars and Motorcycles. 
	Focusing on promoting and expanding the Vintage Cars line could enhance profitability.

__3) Which countries had the best sales results?__
https://github.com/JMDays/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Vehicle%20Wolwide%20Sales/Vehicles%20Worldwide%20Sales%20_.sql#L230

  In all three years, USA Spain and France were the countries with a best Sales performance.
	Company should thereby tailor marketing approaches to reflect local preferences,
	develop partnerships with local influencers or businesses, 
	and use data analytics to identify and exploit specific opportunities in each market.

__4) What was the distribution of order sizes in the 3 years ?__
https://github.com/JMDays/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Vehicle%20Wolwide%20Sales/Vehicles%20Worldwide%20Sales%20_.sql#L249

  The results show a decline in large deals from 2003 to 2005 and a peak in medium and small deals in 2004, followed by a sharp drop in 2005. 
	This suggests a loss of market share or declining customer interest. 
	The company should investigate the reasons for the decline, and enhance product offerings to better meet customer needs.


__5) Which quarter had the best sales performance?__
https://github.com/JMDays/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Vehicle%20Wolwide%20Sales/Vehicles%20Worldwide%20Sales%20_.sql#L262

  Data shows Q4 as consistently the strongest quarter, with the peak in 2004. 
	However, there was a significant drop in Q4 sales from 2004 to 2005, suggesting a need to investigate and address potential issues. 
	While Q4 remains a key focus, efforts to boost performance in Q1 and Q2 could help stabilize sales throughout the year.

__6) Identificate which productlines had the higues value in Sales durign 2005 in each territory.__
https://github.com/JMDays/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Vehicle%20Wolwide%20Sales/Vehicles%20Worldwide%20Sales%20_.sql#L284

  Classic Cars led sales in both EMEA and NA, suggesting strong demand for this type of product in these regions. 
	Vintage Cars was the most popular in APAC.
One recommendation would be to adjust inventory management and distribution strategies to ensure higher stock levels of "Classic Cars" in EMEA and NA regions 
	and more "Vintage Cars" in the APAC region. 
	This could involve reallocating production resources or optimizing supply chain operations to better match regional demand patterns.
