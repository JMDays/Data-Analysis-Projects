__Title:__ Analyzing sales from 3 supermarket branches during part of 2019, using SQL

__Performance analysis by City and Branch__ 
Each one of the 3 branches is located in one of 3 different cities.
Naypyitaw Branch on City C is the branch that has the highest contribution to the overall income at 34%. 
This suggests that it is a top-performing branch. 
The location migh be contributing, but other factors but be analyzes such as customer demographics, or marketing strategies, in order to replicate
this success in other branches
Both Yangon Branch on City A and Mandalay Branch on City B contribute equally to the overall income (33% each). 
However, the company should determine if they are operating at their full potential or if there are opportunities to increase their contribution.

__ Performance Behaviour by type of Client__
Data shows that members and normal customers contribute almost equally to quantity and total income (51% to Members vs 49% to Normal Clients, in both variables), although members tend to spend slightly more per unit.	
The Company should enhance member loyalty and convert more normal customers into members to boost revenue.

__Preferences by Gender__
Women bought more units in fashion and lifestyle products,  but men generated slightly more revenue in electronic accessories, suggesting higher spending in tech categories.
In food and beverages, women bought more, but men generated less revenue,  implying women may choose higher-value items.

__Preferred Payment Method__
Cash is the most frequently used payment method across all cities,  yet it has the lowest average invoice value, suggesting it might be preferred for smaller transactions.
Despite Ewallets being the least used overall, they generate a higher average invoice value compared to credit cards, indicating they might be favored for larger purchases.

__Purchases per Shift__
Branch B has the most purchases (131) in the 3rd Shift, indicating strong late-hour sales.
Branch A peaks in the 2nd Shift, showing high mid-day activity.
Branch C has consistent purchases across all shifts, indicating balanced engagement.
This data could guide staffing and resource allocation, optimizing operations during peak shifts.
