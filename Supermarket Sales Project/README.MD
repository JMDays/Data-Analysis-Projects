__Title:__ Data Analysis of a Sales Dataset. 
In this project, SQL was used for data cleaning, and afterward, to extract some relevant conclusions from a business point of view (POV).
In the second phase, with the data already cleaned, Power BI was used to create visualizations that facilitate the analysis and interpretation of the results.
Above there are links that will re-direct to the respective section of the SQL code used.


__ I - Data Analysis using SQL__

__Performance analysis by City and Branch__ 
https://github.com/JMDays/Data-Analysys-Projects/blob/main/Supermarket%20Sales%20Project/Project%20Supermarket%20Sales.sql#L35

Each one of the 3 branches is located in one of 3 different cities.
Naypyitaw Branch on City C is the branch that has the highest contribution to the overall income at 34%, suggesting that it is a top-performing branch. 

Both Yangon Branch on City A and Mandalay Branch on City B contribute equally to the overall income (33% each). 
However, the company should determine if they are operating at their full potential or if there are opportunities to increase their contribution.


__ Purchasing behaviour by type of client__
https://github.com/JMDays/Data-Analysys-Projects/blob/main/Supermarket%20Sales%20Project/Project%20Supermarket%20Sales.sql#L55

Data shows that members and normal customers contribute almost equally to quantity and total income (51% to Members vs 49% to Normal Clients, in both variables), although members tend to spend slightly more per unit.	
The Company should enhance member loyalty and convert more normal customers into members to boost revenue.

__Preferences by Gender__
https://github.com/JMDays/Data-Analysys-Projects/blob/main/Supermarket%20Sales%20Project/Project%20Supermarket%20Sales.sql#L78

Women bought more units in fashion and lifestyle products,  but men generated slightly more revenue in electronic accessories, suggesting higher spending in tech categories.
In food and beverages, women bought more, but men generated less revenue,  implying women may choose higher-value items.

__Preferred Payment Method__
https://github.com/JMDays/Data-Analysys-Projects/blob/main/Supermarket%20Sales%20Project/Project%20Supermarket%20Sales.sql#L98

Cash is the most frequently used payment method across all cities,  yet it has the lowest average invoice value, suggesting it might be preferred for smaller transactions.
Despite Ewallets being the least used overall, they generate a higher average invoice value compared to credit cards, indicating they might be favored for larger purchases.

__Purchases per Shift__
https://github.com/JMDays/Data-Analysys-Projects/blob/main/Supermarket%20Sales%20Project/Project%20Supermarket%20Sales.sql#L118

Branch B has the most purchases (131) in the 3rd Shift, indicating strong late-hour sales.
Branch A peaks in the 2nd Shift, showing high mid-day activity.
Branch C has consistent purchases across all shifts, indicating balanced engagement.
This data could guide staffing and resource allocation, optimizing operations during peak shifts.
